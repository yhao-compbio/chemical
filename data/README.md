## OFFSIDES

+ [`offsides_compounds/still_missing_compounds.txt`](offsides_compounds/still_missing_compounds.txt) contains names of 776 compounds from OFFSIDES with missing structure data from CHEMBL. [`offsides_compounds/still_missing_compounds_map.tsv`](offsides_compounds/still_missing_compounds_map.tsv) contains names of existing 2D/3D sdf files for these 776 compounds, which were manually downloaded from PubChem.

+ [`offsides_compounds/descriptor_combined/`](offsides_compounds/descriptor_combined/) contains computed molecular descriptors for 2,240 compounds from OFFSIDES.
  + Five types of descriptors were computed:
    + constitutional
    + electronic
    + geometrical
    + hybrid
    + topological

+ [`offsides_compounds/fingerprint_combined/`](offsides_compounds/fingerprint_combined/) contains computed chemical fingerprints for 2,240 compounds from OFFSIDES. 
  + Ten types of fingerprints were computed:
    + circular
    + estate
    + extended 
    + graph
    + hybridization
    + kr
    + maccs
    + pubchem
    + shortestpath
    + standard

## BindingDB

+ [`bindingdb_targets/`](bindingdb_targets/) contains compound-target relationships from BindingDB.
  + Relationships in four types of measurements were included: 
    + pEC50 
    + pIC50 
    + pKd 
    + pKi
  + Relationships in two types of outcomes were included:
    + continuous: the actual binding affinity value is given as the outcome (file name that does not contain 'binary') 
    + binary: a binary value (0/1) is given as the outcome, indicting whether the actual binding affinity value passes a certain threshold. The threshold is defined as the first quantile of binding affinity values among all known drug-target pairs from DrugBank (file name that contains 'binary')
